        'terms_conditions_txt' => 
        '<b>These present Terms, hereinafter also referred to as the "Agreement", apply both to users who use the "Sell it Now" service to view published advertisements and to private or professional advertisers, hereinafter collectively referred to as "Client/s".</b><br>

        *Definition of Services For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Sell it Now" service is understood as the use of the service made available by Presto.it (hereinafter also referred to as "Presto.it") through which the user can enjoy the following features:<br>
        - Repositioning of the advertisement at the top of the list<br>
        - Exposure in the showcase of the website www.subito.it and the m-site m.presto.it <br>
        - Insertion of one\'s own advertisement within the categories reserved for paid listings The service aims at increasing the visibility of advertisements through the repositioning of the same according to different options that vary according to the type of service chosen and its duration. To this end, the Client will be informed about possible and future combinations of repositioning advertisements based on purchases made.<br>
        
        * Limitations Without prejudice to the limitations provided for in art. 8 of the General Terms of Service of Presto.it, within its platform, it reserves the right to refuse the activation of links to external sites or pages offering advertisements contrary to the editorial policy of the site or services in direct and/or indirect competition with its own business, or to directly remove such links, notifying the Client, even in subsequent periods and without the intervening period constituting tacit acceptance.<br>
        * Content of Advertisements Based on the material provided by the Client, Presto.it will proceed, at its sole discretion, to classify the advertisements into one of the product categories provided within its websites, even contrary to the Client\'s request, providing subsequent communication to the Client also solely via email. In the event of purchase of the service referred to in point c and subsequent different categorization, or in the event that differently categorized insertion results in the inclusion of advertisements within the limits provided for by category, the conditions provided for by the following point are considered applicable.<br>
        * Deletion of Advertisements Presto.it reserves the right not to publish advertisements contrary to the editorial policy (better explained here), to proceed at any time with their deletion and, in the most serious cases, to the obscuring of advertisements, as well as to the interruption of any further commercial relationship with the Client, with Presto.it having the right to claim compensation for any damages. Without prejudice to the conditions provided for in art. 7 of the General Terms of Service and the Client\'s responsibility regarding the content of advertisements, Presto.it undertakes, in the event of deletion or rejection of advertisements by itself or in cases provided for by the previous point 3, to refund the Client the amount paid for services not yet performed and/or that have not already commenced, net of the amount attributable to services already used and/or the cost of activation and management of the position.<br>
        * Deletion of the Reserved Area Without prejudice to the conditions provided for in art. 7 of the General Terms of Service, it is expressly understood that in the event that the user voluntarily deletes their reserved area, they will no longer be able to use the "Sell it Now" service purchased and will have nothing to claim from Presto.it regarding the failure to use it, in respect of which, pursuant to the subsequent point 6, any right of withdrawal following its execution is expressly excluded.<br>
        * Right of Withdrawal The private Client has the right to withdraw from this contract for the "Sell it Now" services not yet performed and/or that have not already commenced, to be communicated within 14 days from the date of conclusion of the contract (date of payment of the consideration) or within the shorter contract duration as indicated in the following point by email or registered letter to be sent to the legal headquarters of Presto.it In the event of withdrawal, Presto.it undertakes to refund the Client the amount paid net of the amount attributable to services already used and/or the cost of activation and management of the position, which will be calculated by Presto.it. The Client acknowledges and accepts that, in view of the execution of the contract, any right of withdrawal is expressly excluded. For the purposes of this point, a private Client is understood to be the natural person who uses the "Sell it Now" options for advertisements that have nothing to do with and cannot be attributed to the entrepreneurial, commercial, artisanal, or professional activities carried out, and/or who does not have a VAT number. Therefore, this point does not apply to professional Clients and/or companies who have the right of withdrawal only in cases expressly provided for by law, to be communicated in the manner described.<br>
        * Duration and Effects of Termination of the Contract This Contract shall have the duration relating to each functionality as indicated in point 1 of this contract. The "Repositioning of the advertisement at the top of the list" services will guarantee the presence of the advertisement at the top of the list until the introduction of a new advertisement within the same product category or until the insertion of a new advertisement within the same category. At the expiry of the contractual period and in the event of non-renewal of the service or in the event of withdrawal and/or termination for any reason of this contract, all the listings placed in the manner indicated in point 1 of this contract will be repositioned, restoring the situation prior to the beginning of this agreement. In the case of "Repositioning of the advertisement at the top of the list", it will not be possible to restore the previous situation as this is an instant provision service.
        Consideration - Payment Methods - Late Payment Interest - solve et repete art. 1462 c.c. The consideration required for the actual provision of the Services, as indicated at the time of activation, is expressed in Euros (€) and includes VAT.

        <b>b)</b>prepaid cards (e.g., Postepay),<br>
        <b>c)</b> PayPal. <br>
        It is expressly understood that payment will be executed immediately regardless of the provision of the purchased service. In the event that the service is not actually activated following the conclusion of payment for technical and/or service availability reasons, the corresponding amount will be refunded to the user. The payment process for the above methods under letters a), b), and c) may be managed by PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449, Luxembourg, which, by virtue of agreements between Subito.it S.r.l. and itself, may also be authorized to issue an invoice in its name.
